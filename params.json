  "body": "# As Simple As Rack\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Z3dKcE3.jpg\" /></p>\r\n## Description\r\n![Medium example](/Textures/Things/Buildings/Furniture/StorageMedium.png) ![Double Medium example](/Textures/Things/Buildings/Furniture/StorageMediumD.png) ![Medium example](/Textures/Things/Buildings/Furniture/StorageSingle.png) ![Double Medium example](/Textures/Things/Buildings/Furniture/StorageSmallD.png)\r\n\r\n- Add simple racked storage solutions, accessible after smithing research (all structures need a bit of metal as frame). They are declined in various size and can be constructed from stone, wood or rock.\r\n- They can store any items in the game but are not preventing decaying (meaning that your stored items still need to be under a roof to stop decaying; putting a storage rack outside will not suffice)\r\nDefault storage settings are set to : \"Normal priority\", \"all except corpses & chunks\" and \"No rotten allowed\"\r\n- Those ones are \"minifiable\" : you can move them around without deconstructing them.\r\n\r\n![Medium example](/Textures/Things/Buildings/Furniture/RefrigeratedStorageMedium.png) ![Double Medium example](/Textures/Things/Buildings/Furniture/RefrigeratedStorageMediumD.png) ![Medium example](/Textures/Things/Buildings/Furniture/RefrigeratedStorageSingle.png) ![Double Medium example](/Textures/Things/Buildings/Furniture/RefrigeratedStorageSmallD.png)\r\n\r\n- Also add refrigerated storage solutions, accessible after electric research.\r\nThey are declined in the same sizes and can be constructed from stone, wood or rock **+** a fixed amount of steel and one component.\r\n- They can store any items in the game ***and*** are refrigerated so they preserve foods, meals, medicine and corpses from rotting. They need to be powered for that.\r\n_Note_ : even unpowered (or switched off) items stored in it will still not decay because it's a door-closed storage.\r\n- Those ones are not movable but they're so sturdy that they can be use as roof supports (if you have **really** big storage needs :-p). It may be wise to [review roof-collapsing rules on the wiki](http://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Structure)\r\n\r\n![Lamp](/Textures/Things/Buildings/Furniture/LampCeiling.png)\r\n\r\n- Also add a simple neon lamp just because it was with the pack in which I salvaged the storage graphics and it goes well with the rest graphic-wise\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n[CCL mod](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=16599) is mandatory and should be set to be launched **BEFORE** this mod in modlist\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\nAll graphical assets (and the idea about using roof holding structures) are from **Saularian** in [[A11 Terra Firma Mod Pack](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=12580.msg126663#msg126663)]      \r\nA big thank you to the ![CCL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RimWorldCCLTeam/CommunityCoreLibrary/master/WebGraphics/CCL_Button.png) team, half of the mod use your modified classes\r\n",
