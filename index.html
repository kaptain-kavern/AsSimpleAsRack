<ul>
<li>Add simple racked storage solutions, accessible after smithing research (all structures need a bit of metal as frame). They are declined in various size and can be constructed from stone, wood or rock.</li>
<li>They can store any items in the game but are not preventing decaying (meaning that your stored items still need to be under a roof to stop decaying; putting a storage rack outside will not suffice)
Default storage settings are set to : "Normal priority", "all except corpses &amp; chunks" and "No rotten allowed"</li>
<li>Those ones are "minifiable" : you can move them around without deconstructing them.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Also add refrigerated storage solutions, accessible after electric research.
They are declined in the same sizes and can be constructed from stone, wood or rock <strong>+</strong> a fixed amount of steel and one component.</li>
<li>They can store any items in the game <strong><em>and</em></strong> are refrigerated so they preserve foods, meals, medicine and corpses from rotting. They need to be powered for that.
<em>Note</em> : even unpowered (or switched off) items stored in it will still not decay because it's a door-closed storage.</li>
<li>Those ones are not movable but they're so sturdy that they can be use as roof supports (if you have <strong>really</strong> big storage needs :-p). It may be wise to <a href="http://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Structure">review roof-collapsing rules on the wiki</a>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Also add a simple neon lamp just because it was with the pack in which I salvaged the storage graphics and it goes well with the rest graphic-wise</li>
</ul>

<p>All graphical assets (and the idea about using roof holding structures) are from <strong>Saularian</strong> in [<a href="https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=12580.msg126663#msg126663">A11 Terra Firma Mod Pack</a>]<br>
A big thank you to the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RimWorldCCLTeam/CommunityCoreLibrary/master/WebGraphics/CCL_Button.png" alt="CCL"> team, half of the mod use your modified classes</p>
