- Add simple racked storage solutions, accessible after smithing research (all structures need a bit of metal as frame). They are declined in various size and can be constructed from stone, wood or rock.
- They can store any items in the game but are not preventing decaying (meaning that your stored items still need to be under a roof to stop decaying; putting a storage rack outside will not suffice)
Default storage settings are set to : "Normal priority", "all except corpses & chunks" and "No rotten allowed"
- Those ones are "minifiable" : you can move them around without deconstructing them.

- Also add refrigerated storage solutions, accessible after electric research.
They are declined in the same sizes and can be constructed from stone, wood or rock **+** a fixed amount of steel and one component.
- They can store any items in the game ***and*** are refrigerated so they preserve foods, meals, medicine and corpses from rotting. They need to be powered for that.
_Note_ : even unpowered (or switched off) items stored in it will still not decay because it's a door-closed storage.
- Those ones are not movable but they're so sturdy that they can be use as roof supports (if you have **really** big storage needs :-p). It may be wise to [review roof-collapsing rules on the wiki](http://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Structure)

- Also add a simple neon lamp just because it was with the pack in which I salvaged the storage graphics and it goes well with the rest graphic-wise

## Instructions
[CCL mod](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=16599) is mandatory and should be set to be launched **BEFORE** this mod in modlist

## Credits
All graphical assets (and the idea about using roof holding structures) are from **Saularian** in [[A11 Terra Firma Mod Pack](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=12580.msg126663#msg126663)]      
A big thank you to the ![CCL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RimWorldCCLTeam/CommunityCoreLibrary/master/WebGraphics/CCL_Button.png) team, half of the mod use your modified classes
